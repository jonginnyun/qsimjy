## Overview
This package is a modularized version of a simple quantum dot device simulator. It is designed to perform approximate simulations for quantum dot devices, offering tools for potential calculation, solving the Schrödinger equation, micromagnetic simulations, and stray field computations. The project originates from the **Integrated Quantum Systems Laboratory** at **Seoul National University**, and the primary author is **Jonginn Yun**.

## Features
The package provides the following key tools:

1. **Green Function-Based Potential Calculation**
   - Computes the electrostatic potential using Green's function methods.

2. **Schrödinger Equation Solver**
   - Solves the Schrödinger equation for quantum systems using a finite-difference method.

3. **Static Micromagnetic Simulation**
   - Performs simulations of micromagnetic systems with a focus on static configurations.

4. **Stray Field Calculation**
   - Computes stray fields generated by micromagnets.

## Assumptions and Limitations
This simulator uses several approximations and assumptions that users should be aware of:

### Potential Calculation
- The **Green’s function** assumes a **Dirichlet boundary condition** for an infinite planar boundary.
- A uniform **SiGe medium** is used as the substrate material.

### Schrödinger Equation Solver
- The Schrödinger equation is solved using the **finite-difference method**.
- Results are accurate primarily for the **ground state** of the system.

### Micromagnetic Simulation
- Simulations are designed exclusively for **cobalt micromagnets** with an **hcp (hexagonal close-packed) structure**.
- Assumes **uniaxial anisotropy**, with all physical constants set specifically for cobalt.

## Installation
To install the package, ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher and the necessary dependencies installed. Then, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- Required Python packages (automatically installed with `pip`):
  - `numpy`
  - `ezdxf`
  - `shapely`
  - `ubermag`
  - `matplotlib`

## Usage
The package can be imported and used in Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Below is a quick example of usage:

### Example: Importing the Package
```python
import qsimjy as qsim

# Quantum dot potential calculation
potential = qsim.quantumdot.calculate_potential(parameters)

# Solve the Schrödinger equation
wavefunction, energy = qsim.solver.solve_schrodinger(parameters)

# Micromagnetic simulation
micromagnet_state = qsim.magnet.simulate_static_state(parameters)

# Stray field calculation
stray_field = qsim.magnet.calculate_stray_field(parameters)
```
